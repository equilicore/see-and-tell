This component extracts segments from audio that has speech. It uses `pyannote` voice diarization pipeline provided on [Github](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio). The component contains a single file `speech.py` that has a callable class `SpeechDetector`. The component has not developed to be run separately from pipeline.
